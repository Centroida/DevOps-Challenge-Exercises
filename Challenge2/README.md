# DevOps Challenge \#2 #

In this challenge, you will move the ASP.NET application to a Docker container. 
After you have created and tested the image locally, you will set up an Azure Container Registry and use the build pipeline
to build and publish the image to this registry.
Finally you will publish the container to an already created Azure Container Service cluster using the Kubernetes user interface.

When you succesfully completed the challenge, your webapplication is running in a Docker container on a cluster.

## Pre-requisites ##
*   Pipeline per team
*   Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise (with the Coded UI test component)
*   Docker for Windows [installed](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/InstallDocker.msi) 
*   Azure Subscription
*   Team Project for venue with git repo per challenge team; VSTS account per participant

## Getting started ##
* [Verify the Docker installation and explore the application](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#check-versions-of-docker-engine-compose-and-machine)
* Clone the started code from [https://github.com/GlobalDevOpsBootcamp/challenge1](https://github.com/GlobalDevOpsBootcamp/challenge1) to your VSTS project as described in challenge1

## Achievement \#1 - Create a Dockerfile and build a local Docker image with the webapplication installed ##
### What do we need to rollout an ASP.NET website to a windows docker container? ###

To run an ASP.NET 4.X website you need the following things:

*   The Operating system with IIS installed
*   ASP.NET 4.X installed
*   Webdeploy installed

### Building the container with IIS, ASP.NET and Webdeploy ###
* Validate that the docker image microsoft/aspnet (this image contains OS with IIS and ASP.NET) is on your local machine by using the command   ```docker images```
you should see in the list microsoft/aspnet.
If it is not there you can get it by using the command ```docker pull micrsoft/aspnet```
* Get the file named [Dockerfile](./provisioning-docker/Dockerfile) (without extension)

### Create publishing profile for web application ###
* In Visual Studio right click the MvcMusicStore project
* Select Publish
* Select Create new profile
* Select IIS, FTP, etc. --> OK
* Select `Web Deploy Package` as Publish method
* Package location: `C:\temp-docker\MvcMusicStore.zip`
* Sitename: `Default Web Site`
* Save the profile
* Select CustomProfile and click Publish

### Create image and run locally ###
* Copy `dockerfile` to c:\temp-docker from the MvcMusic store repo folder: provisioning-docker
* Copy `fixAcls.ps1` to c:\temp-docker from the MvcMusic store repo folder: provisioning-docker
* Copy `WebDeploy_2_10_amd64_en-US.msi` to c:\temp-docker from the MvcMusic store repo folder: provisioning-docker
* Open PowerShell command prompt and execute:

```
    docker build . -t mycontainerizedwebsite
    docker run -p 80:80 -d --name mvcmusicstore mycontainerizedwebsite
    docker inspect --format '{{.NetworkSettings.Networks.nat.IPAddress}}' mvcmusicstore

```

* Use the returned IP address to navigate to the website in your browser : `http://[IP_Adress]` or `http://[IP_Adress]/MvcMusicStore_deploy`

* In order to connect to the remote database locally, you can add your IP Address to the permitted addresses of your database firewall (You can obtain it from the application error once you open the docker image).

![firewall](./img/firewall.png)

* To stop the container
```
    docker stop mvcmusicstore
    docker rm mvcmusicstore
```

## Achievement \#2 - Set up an Azure Container Registry ##
* Navigate to the Azure Portal of your Azure Subscription
* Navigate to the Container Registries service
* Click on Add to add a Azure Container Registry
* Enter a name for the registry in the following format:  centro<TEAMNAME>
* Use the same resource group  
* Click on Create

* Copy the login server name from the overview page of your Container Registry (eg. centro<TEAMNAME>.azurecr.io) for later use.

* Navigate to the access keys of your Container Registry and `enable` Admin user
* Copy the `username` and `password2`


## Achievement \#3 - Create a build definition for your containerized application ##
* Navigate to your VSTS environment and select Builds
* Duplicate the Build Definition from Challenge 1 (from the Build list, click on '...' and then choose "Clone")

### Change task: Build solution **\*.sln (to publish a WebDeploy package on build)
* Click on the Build solution **\*.sln task
* Change the build to 
```
 /p:DeployOnBuild=true;PublishProfile=CustomProfile 
 /p:WebPublishMethod=Package /p:PackageAsSingleFile=true 
 /p:SkipInvalidConfigurations=true /p:PackageLocation="$(build.stagingDirectory)/provisioning-docker"

* Add a Publish Artifact task
* Change Path to Publish to: ```$(build.stagingDirectory)```
* Change Artifact name to: ```MvcMusicStore```
